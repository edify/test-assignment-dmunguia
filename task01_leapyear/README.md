# Leap Years

We are defining a leap year as follows:

> Every year that is exactly divisible by four is a leap year, except for years that are exactly
> divisible by 100, but these centurial years are leap years if they are exactly divisible by 400.
> For example, the years 1700, 1800, and 1900 were not leap years, but the years 1600 and 2000 were.

Complete the function `isLeapYear` in `src/calendar.js` to receive an integer representing a `year` and return a boolean `true`
if the year is leap, or `false` otherwise.

You can run the tests by first installing the dependencies using

```bash
npm install
```

And then running

```bash
npm test
```
