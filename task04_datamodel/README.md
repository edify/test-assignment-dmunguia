# Design a simple data model

A university needs to keep track of its ongoing courses for the current semester. Many students can be enrolled in a course instance. A single course instance can be taught by one or two teachers. Courses are related to a subject, for example "Programming 101" or "Data Structures". Students will have final grades for the course.

Design a relational database schema using the MySQL DDL dialect to model the previous requirements. Add your DDL statements to the file `ddl/model.sql`.
